# **Anor Londo Lighting Fix**

## **Overview**

Anor Londo, the legendary city of the gods, is one of the most breathtaking locations in *Dark Souls*. However, the game's lighting system does not always do justice to its grandeur. This mod aims to **restore, enhance, and refine** the lighting of Anor Londo, bringing it closer to the original artistic vision.

This project focuses on fixing broken light sources, improving ambient lighting, enhancing shadows, and balancing brightness levels to create a more immersive and atmospheric experience.
