# **Anor Londo Lighting Fix**

## **Overview**

Anor Londo, the legendary city of the gods, is one of the most breathtaking locations in *Dark Souls*. However, the game's lighting system does not always do justice to its grandeur. This mod aims to **restore, enhance, and refine** the lighting of Anor Londo, bringing it closer to the original artistic vision.

This project focuses on fixing broken light sources, improving ambient lighting, enhancing shadows, and balancing brightness levels to create a more immersive and atmospheric experience.

- **Performance Optimized** – Tested for stable frame rates with no major performance impact.  
- **Compatible with Texture and Gameplay Mods** – Works seamlessly with graphical enhancements and gameplay changes.  
- **Includes Cheat Table** – Optional Cheat Engine table for gameplay customization.

## **Troubleshooting**

### **1. The mod isn't working (no visible changes):**
- Ensure the files are installed in the correct directory.
- For PTDE, make sure texture override is enabled in `dsfix.ini` (`enableTextureOverride 1`).
- For DSR, ensure Mod Engine is correctly configured.
- Clear the shader cache (`Documents\NBGI\DarkSouls\shadercache`) and restart the game.

### **2. The game crashes on startup:**
- Remove any conflicting mods.
- If using ReShade or ENB, test with and without the mod.
- Verify game files through Steam to rule out file corruption.

### **3. Significant FPS drops in Anor Londo:**
- Lower in-game shadow settings.
- Disable demanding ReShade effects.
- Use the upcoming "Performance Mode" version of the mod.

### **4. Cheat Table is not working:**
- Ensure Cheat Engine is properly installed and running.
- Open the `.CT` file after launching Dark Souls.
- Confirm Cheat Engine is attached to the correct process (`DarkSouls.exe`).
- Run Cheat Engine as Administrator if necessary.
